What is colorir?
----------------

colorir is a package developed to unify your workflow with colors across different projects.

With colorir you can:

- Keep a unified selection of colors you like and use them in your different projects;
- Use these colors directly as input for other graphical or web frameworks;
- Easily convert between different color systems and formats;
- Create gradients between colors and sample from them;
- Easily visualize swatches of colors in the terminal;
- And much more!

colorir was designed to be your best friend when dealing with colors so that you won't ever need to write this kind of code again:

.. code-block:: python

    BLACK = (0, 0, 0)
    WHITE = (255, 255, 255)
    CSS_ALICEBLUE = (240, 248, 255)
    COOL_PURPLE = (11, 0, 51)
    MY_FAVORITE_GREEN = (113, 180, 141)
    TOP_NOTCH_RED = (131, 34, 50)
    # ... unnecessarily long and ugly list of colors
